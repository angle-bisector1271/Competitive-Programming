Binary exponentiation:
Suppose we have to calculate n^m, we can think of m in terms of its binary representation.
n^m=n^(2^m1+2^m2...)=n^(2^m1)*n^(2^m2)....
Assuming m1<m2...
we initialize our answer as 1.
we square n m1 times and multiply with answer, then we square n m2-m1 times and multiply with answer and so on.
